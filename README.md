Editor for AC emu creature weenie files with batch update functionality. The editor focuses on a subset of common properties rather than providing comprehensive coverage.

Other features:

Profile a creature for how often a player will hit, evade, land or resist.

Check creature PCAP skill estimates, and how they compare to the creature's current skills. 

Upgrade all of the creature's spells automatically (e.g., from level 7 to level 8).
